## Problem Solving Techniques (Project management)

1. Define the Problem
2. Determine the Causes
    - This involves performing a cause and effect analysis.
    example of implementation using fishbone diagram(ishikawa)
    ```
    A cause and effect diagram can be created in six steps...
        - Draw Problem Statement
        - Draw Major Cause Categories
        - Brainstorm Causes
        - Categorize Causes
        - Determine Deeper Causes
        - Identify Root Causes
    ```

3. develop possible solutions to the problem 
    -  problem solving methods you can use for coming up with solutions are brainstorming and mind mapping

4. Select the Best Solution
    - this requires that a trade-off analysis is done. 
    To perform the trade-off analysis, define the critical criteria for the problem that you can use to evaluate how each solution compares to each other. The evaluation can be done using a simple matrix. The highest ranking solution will be your best solution for this problem.

5. Take Action
    - If the solution involves several actions or requires action from others, it is a good idea to create an action plan and treat it as a mini-project.
