## Hashing
> Hashing is generating a value or values from a string of text using a mathematical function.

MD5 - message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. 
collisions - when the same hash code is produced for different inputs
linear probing - a scheme for preventing collisions
