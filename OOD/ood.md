## Object Oriented Design
Object-oriented design (OOD) is the process of using an object-oriented methodology to design a computing system or application.

Object-oriented system design involves defining the context of a system followed by designing the architecture of the system.

Object-oriented system design involves: 
- Definition of the context of the system
- Designing system architecture
- Identification of the objects in the system
- Construction of design models
- Specification of object interfaces

various diagrams can be drawn in each step:
