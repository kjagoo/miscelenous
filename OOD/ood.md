## Object Oriented Design
Object-oriented design (OOD) is the process of using an object-oriented methodology to design a computing system or application.

Object-oriented system design involves defining the context of a system followed by designing the architecture of the system.

Object-oriented system design involves: 
- Definition of the context of the system
- Designing system architecture
- Identification of the objects in the system
- Construction of design models
- Specification of object interfaces

various diagrams can be drawn in each step:
sample system: [amity_space_allocation](https://github.com/kjagoo/Amity_Space_Allocation)
```
Problem Description
model a room allocation system for one of Andelaâ€™s facilities called Amity.

Constraints
Amity has rooms which can be offices or living spaces. An office can accommodate a maximum of 6 people. A living space can accommodate a maximum of 4 people.

A person to be allocated could be a fellow or staff. Staff cannot be allocated living spaces. Fellows have a choice to choose a living space or not.

This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to people at random.

## Principles used in OOD and OOP
- Encapsulation - is the process of binding both attributes and methods together within a class
- Data Hiding - a class is designed such that its data (attributes) can be accessed only by its class methods and insulated from direct outside access.
- Message Passing - Objects in a system may communicate with each other using message passing. 
- Inheritance -  this is the mechanism that permits new classes to be created out of existing classes by extending and refining its capabilities. 
- Polymorphism - Polymorphism allows objects with different internal structures to have a common external interface. Polymorphism is particularly effective while implementing inheritance.
